# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE: Desktop OAuth Client Secret Exposure ⚠️
# The VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET will be bundled into the application JavaScript.
# This is a known limitation of desktop OAuth flows using tauri-plugin-google-auth.
#
# MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
# 1. Use SEPARATE OAuth clients for development and production
# 2. Restrict your production OAuth client to specific domains (if applicable)
# 3. Monitor Google Cloud Console for unauthorized usage
# 4. Rotate credentials if they become compromised
# 5. Consider using biometric authentication (which doesn't expose secrets)
#
# For development, using test credentials is acceptable. For production,
# create a dedicated OAuth client and monitor its usage closely.

# Get these from Google Cloud Console:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 2. Create a new project or select existing
# 3. APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Configure
#    - App name: "Latch Password Manager"
#    - User support email: (your email)
#    - Scopes: openid, email, profile
#    - Add yourself as a test user
# 4. APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID
#    - Application type: Web application
#    - Name: "Latch Desktop App" (use "Dev" for development, "Prod" for production)
#    - Authorized redirect URIs: http://localhost
# 5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

# Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID
# Format: xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here

# Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret
# Format: GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# ⚠️ This value will be visible in the bundled application. Use separate credentials for dev/prod.
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here

# 32-byte App Secret for OAuth Key Derivation
# This is used to derive the encryption key for your vault
# IMPORTANT: Must be at least 32 bytes (64 hex chars or 44+ base64 chars)
# Minimum length enforced at compile time for security
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
